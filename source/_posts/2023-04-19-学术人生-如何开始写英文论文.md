三年前我从美国博士毕业，发表了第一，二，三作者文章总共有十几篇，因而对学术尤其是我所在的科技行业的论文写作有了非常深的体会。当然发表的都是国际上的sci的论文，虽然我在美国不太清楚国内对于sci以及论文档次的界定。但因为自己从事材料，纳米和能源科学，论文的IF炒的都很高。

关于科技论文英文写作，我的方法是积累，积累，再积累。你总结和积累的知识储备将成为你日后写作任何英文论文的捷径。那么具体操作办法就是多读你本身领域的顶尖期刊。什么叫顶尖，在我的材料领域顶尖就是Nature系列，Advanced Materials系列, Nano Letters, ACS Nano, Energy & Environmental Science等。

然后我发现Abstract, Introduction, Experiment, Results, Discussion, Conclusions, Supporting Information的写法都是不太相通的，所以我在每个板块都进行了分门别类的积累，具体是关于词汇，句子，段落和最重要的逻辑。但是这些不同板块也有很多相通之处，很多词汇，句子其实都是可以用在各处的。你会在这些部分都发现有很多在你本领域内高频出现的词汇，短句，句子，这些都是你从实际的高水平论文种多次筛选出来的，意味着曾被你领域内的大牛，大师，同行们多次使用，所以肯定是万无一失的。同时还有作用就是让你熟习了同义转换，以免某一文章里某个词出现太多次。

比如在我的材料科学，你会惊奇的发现我们总需要表达一些相似的东西。你总需要在文章中表示：

**表示获得关注**（常用于Abstract, Introduction等需要开篇的地方）

In the past 10 years, considerable attention has been paid to perovskite materials falling within the classification La1−xSrxMO3(where M is a transition metal) as catalysts for oxygen reduction.

Among them, Mn-based oxides have attracted extensive interest because of low cost, high abundance, environmental friendliness and considerable activity.

Rechargeable magnesium batteries have lately received great attention for large-scale energy storage systems due to their high volumetric capacities, low materials cost, and safe characteristic.

**表示本领域目前出现的困境**（常用于Abstract, Introduction等处，尤其是在自己的新idea出现之前的地方） 所谓革命尚未成功，同志们仍需努力

However, rechargeable Mg–air batteries with reversible oxygen reduction and evolution reactions are facing challenges and it is worthwhile devoting much effort to this.

As can be seen, the development of cathode materials convenient for rechargeable Mg batteries remains an ongoing challenge due to strict requirements for the intercalation compound that ensures fast Mg 2+ ion transport in combination with a high operating voltage.

Theoretical and experimental investigations on new cathode materials such as V2O5, MoS2, Li4Ti5O12, and MnO2 have demonstrated promising results, but it is generally agreed that a high-voltage high-capacity cathode with fast Mg2+ intercalation kinetics has yet to be identified.

Although some encouraging progress have been made, developing appropriate electrode materials with high capacity and good reversibility is less successful and still require further research.

XXX, with the reduced consumption of Pt while still maintaining satisfactory catalytic activity and stability.

This is a noteworthy finding because mullite-based oxides are significantly less expensive and more abundant than platinum group metals and offer a promising alternative route for tackling the oxygen activation problems.

**形容多的，巨大的**

extensive, intensitve, considerable, tremendous

In the past 10 years, considerable attention has been paid to perovskite materials falling within the classification La1−xSrxMO3(where M is a transition metal) as catalysts for oxygen reduction.

Among them, Mn-based oxides have attracted extensive interest because of low cost, high abundance, environmental friendliness and considerable activity.

In recent years, theoretical and experimental investigations of novel cathode materials for MIBs have increased tremendously.

A critical element in the pursuit of this quest is the discovery of efficient and cost-effective catalysts for use in electrochemical energy conversion processes1,2 such as the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), both of which are central to the efficiencies of direct-solar and electrolytic water-splitting4,5 devices, fuel cells6 and metal–air batteries.

**表示展示性能** (这个通用于Abstract, Introduction, Conclusion 主要用于Results and Discussion部分)

present, demonstrate, reveal, show, exhibit, feature, posses, have, display, depict, deliver

The as-prepared hydrogenated Pt/CaMnO3 hybrid exhibits a 5-fold higher ORR mass activity and an 11-fold higher specific activity than that of the benchmark Pt/C catalyst.

SEM results display average particle sizes of ~50 nm, which is consistent with the XRD line-broadening results.

（这些动词很多可以互换，但还是有些小区别的，比如这里如果是展示形貌和图画的话，用display这个词更舒服）

Galvanostatic studies show that expanded graphite can deliver a high reversible capacity of 284mAhg-1 at a current density of 20mAg-1.

Highly symmetric peak profiles are observed which signify good reversibility of both anodic and cathodic reactions.

The feasibility of graphite in a Na full cell is also confirmed in conjunction with the Na 1.5VPO4.8F0.7 cathode, delivering an energy of ~120 Wh kg-1 while maintaining ~70% of the initial capacity after 250 cycles.

boost/ promote

Advances in perovskite-type materials have shown that they possess mixed ionic and electronic conductivity, which is beneficial for catalytic activity.

**表示吹牛** （常用于Abstract, Conclusions和其它需要总结强调自己的工作多牛逼的地方）

**开启本领域的天窗，解决了瓶颈，颠覆了传统理念。吹，接着吹**

In this Article, we report a volcano relationship between a material property that serves as the activity descriptor and the intrinsic ORR activity of perovskite-based oxides. Such information has predictive power and provides insights into the design of new catalysts with enhanced ORR activity similar to those reported for platinum-based metals.

The viewpoint from the electronic structure proposed in this study might pave a new way to design electrode materials for multivalent-ion batteries.

The utilization of such a highly electrochemical stable GF unlocks the critical bottleneck of incompatibility among all battery parts, especially parasitic corrosive reactions between electrolyte and currently available current collector, which takes a big step forward towards Mg-based batteries' practical applications.

Therefore, an ether-based (DEGDME) electrolyte is believed to endow CoS@rGO electrode with remarkable electrochemical properties in the present studies.

However, some precipitation of insoluble surface species obviously occurs in pristine solutions, which impedes Mg deposition but does not fully avoid it.

Catalysts located on the left side of the volcano in Figure 1 bind oxygen too strongly, and thus the reaction is retarded by desorption of the OHads.

These studies have shown that the discovery of cathode materials is mainly inhibited by the nature of Mg2+ ions:

However, the lack of suitable cathode materials allowing reversible intercalation of Zn2+ hinders the development of zinc-ion batteries.

However, a lack of fundamental understanding of the ORR mechanism and the material properties that govern catalytic activity hampers the development of highly active oxide catalysts.

The prohibitive cost and scarcity of the noble-metal catalysts needed for catalysing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells and metal–air batteries limit the commercialization of these clean-energy technologies.

当你熟悉了以上这些常用的动词，形容词，词组短句，长句和学术术语以后，写出像样测学术论文就减轻了很多障碍。之后就是把它们应用到文章的各个部分就好了。

然后要注意几个部分的写作规则。比如Abstract，通常十几句话，短小精炼，把idea，原创性，实验结果和意义说清楚就好了，不要累赘。Conclusion也是一样，但是侧重于总结，也可以提实验结果，强调意义，并可以加上对今后工作的展望。

Introduction是最重要的，需要把你所做工作的领域向大家介绍一下，然后目前发展瓶颈说清楚，再之后提出自己的idea, 概念，方法或者新事物。大部分对前人工作的总结和批判是在这个部分完成的，参考文献也大部分发生在这部分，所以耗费时间最长，最考察作者的科研深度和对文献的熟悉度，如果有很多重要工作漏掉了没有引用，在审稿的时候就会被编辑大加批判的。

Results & Discussion这部分当然就是介绍自己每一个所做实验的结果。数据分析和结果讨论和Introduction同等重要，考察的是作者的学术功底，能否在已有数据上分析出科学合理的结果，并作证自己的结论。

除了以上我自己个人总结的这些，也非常推荐周耀旗老师的那篇经典博客“科学网—怎样掌握写好英语科技论文的诀窍”(http://blog.sciencenet.cn/blog-472757-362153.html)。我自己之前也是读了他这篇文章很多遍。周老师提供的是科学方法论，我提供的是干货，hoho

最后自己的论文一定要改上好多遍，找同事，找导师，找外国人，不知不觉就改了个十遍二十遍，终于可以看了。自以为写的很好的部分在别人眼里看来很可能是累赘，前后矛盾的地方旁人读起来也比自己更容易发现。比如下面是我的某个文章manuscirpt，找过很多高人修正后已经面目全非了，但却是必须经历的过程。这篇文章后来在去年发表出去了。

除了这些，多借鉴他人的经验总是好的。除了论文英文写作各部分的总结，我觉得也需要注重科研本身和寻找论文创新点，可以看看SCI论文写作的总结和书籍，还有知乎live。比如下面这个“吴博士聊科研”的知乎live我基本都听了，有七八个。相比我的单纯的回答，他更总结成了方法论，而且还出了书，目前是回国后全职做论文写作培训公司。这里我放进来认为对大家有帮助的他的2个很不错的live。
